## üéØ Why Another Browser Assistant?

While there are many AI assistants out there, Browser Mc Wingspan focuses on simplicity and hackability.

That's why we've made customization as straightforward as adding your code to `index::handleResponse` 
and using our built-in helpers for page content and LLM interactions.
